basics:
part4: map is a bulit in function that runs a function for every list item and returns it as another list; instead of writing for loops ourselves. very useful.
lambda function is very short form of a function for one time use.
with list, map and lambda we can easily take a list of numbers, mutilply each number to any number e.g. 3 and return the results as another list.  on one line only.
Filter: is opposit of map. it gives a condition with lambda and if the condition was ture in any items in a given list, it returns those items as a list.
the combination of list and tuple is so popular in python. we need to learn it well. 
e.g. [(1,2),(2,5),(5,4)]
packing would unpack tuples from the list.
