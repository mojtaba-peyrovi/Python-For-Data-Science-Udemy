Plotly & Cufflinks:
PLotly is so cool. it can show data visualisation charts online using some javascript and make charts niceer.
how to call it?
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotly import __version__
%matplotlib inline
import cufflinks as cf
from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs,init_notebook_mode,plot,iplot
init_notebook_mode(connected=True)
cf.go_offline()

then to use it we just say: df.iplot()

parameters:
df.iplot(kind='scatter',x='A',y='B',mode='markers')  ==> without markers, python will make linear plot as default.(connects all dots with line)
 (Data types in a  df:  categorical or numerical)
df.sum().iplot(kind='bar') ==> sum() is an aggregate function that we use for numerical data types for using some specific plot types such as bar part that require categrical  data.
df.sum().iplot(kind='box') ==> it does the aggregation itselfs. so we can use numerical data.
df3.iplot(kind='surface',colorscale='rdylbu') ==> needs a dataframe of 3 dimension data.
df['A'].iplot(kind='hist',bins=25)==> makes histogram.  => bins is optional. there are other parameters too.
df[['A','B']].iplot(kind='spread') ==> shows the spread of columns A , B and we can compare them. its useful for stock data.
df.iplot(kind='bubble',x='A',y='B',size='C') ==> makes bubble plots. the size of the bubbles are based on a third variable.  UN reports use this type so much.
